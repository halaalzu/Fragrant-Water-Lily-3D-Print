# Fragrant Water-Lily Puzzle

The **Fragrant Water-Lily** is a mechanical, 3D-printed puzzle inspired by the organic movement and structure of a water lily. The project explores rotational motion, gear mechanisms, and modular assembly through a flower-like form that opens and closes via interlocking components.

This project was developed as part of a joint design and prototyping course project and emphasizes iterative design, mechanical problem-solving, and physical fabrication.

## Project Overview

The puzzle consists of a central gear mechanism connected to multiple detachable petals. When the internal mechanism is rotated, the petals move in a coordinated motion, mimicking the opening and closing behavior of a water lily.

The design combines:
- Mechanical gears
- Hinged and detachable components
- A puzzle-like base assembly
- Iterative refinement through physical prototyping

The final object functions as both a mechanical puzzle and a sculptural desk object.

## Key Features

- **Gear-Driven Motion**  
  A central gear drives the synchronized movement of the petals.

- **Detachable Petals**  
  Individual petals can be removed and reassembled, adding a puzzle element to the object.

- **Puzzle-Like Base**  
  The base is composed of multiple parts that must be assembled correctly for the mechanism to function.

- **Iterative Mechanical Design**  
  The final design incorporates multiple improvements over earlier prototypes, including reinforced gears, thicker petals, and improved tolerances.

## Design & Iteration Process

The design evolved through several stages:
- Early concept exploration and sketching
- CAD development of gears, hinges, and base components
- Initial 3D print testing that revealed mechanical failures
- Refinement of gear direction, wall thickness, and petal strength
- Final print with improved durability and functionality

Key challenges included gear alignment, material fragility, and dimensional accuracy.

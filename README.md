# Fragrant Water-Lily 3D Print

A 3D-printed mechanical puzzle inspired by the organic motion of a water lily. This project was created for a design course (BME 101L) and explores rotational motion, gear mechanisms, modular assembly, and iterative prototyping through an artistic yet functional form.

---

## Overview

The **Fragrant Water-Lily** is a sculptural puzzle that combines mechanics and aesthetics. When the internal mechanism is rotated, multiple petals move together, mimicking the opening and closing motion of a real water lily.

## Printing & Assembly

1. Print all parts using your preferred slicer (e.g. Cura, PrusaSlicer).  
2. Use standard PLA settings; ensure good layer adhesion for small gears.  
3. Follow **Water-Lily Assembly Instructions.pdf** to assemble the base, gears, and petals.  
4. Test rotation and adjust fit as needed for smooth motion.

**Tip:** Accurate printer calibration and tolerances are critical for reliable gear movement.
